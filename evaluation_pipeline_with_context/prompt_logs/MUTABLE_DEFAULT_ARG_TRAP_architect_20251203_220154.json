  "user_prompt": "\n        REPOSITORY CONTEXT:\n        # Repository Overview\nThis project appears to be a minimal implementation of a Core Banking System, focusing on defining basic database models (like `Account`) and managing database connections. It uses SQLAlchemy for ORM and persistence, likely serving as a foundation for transaction processing logic.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy\n- Key Dependencies: `sqlalchemy`, `pytest` (for testing)\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe structure is flat, separating database configuration (`database.py`), ORM models (`models.py`), and testing logic (`tests/`). The core logic seems to revolve around defining and interacting with SQLAlchemy models.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nUses SQLAlchemy's declarative base for ORM definition. Models use standard Python class definitions inheriting from `Base`. Database connections are configured to use an in-memory SQLite database for development/testing.\n\n# Key Files\n- `models.py`: Defines the core database schema, specifically the `Account` table.\n- `database.py`: Configures the SQLAlchemy engine, session factory (`Session`), and the declarative base (`Base`).\n- `tests/test_batch.py`: Contains unit tests, specifically highlighting a potential bug related to transaction batch isolation/leakage.\n- `services.py` (Implied/Missing): Contains the `log_transaction` function, which is the subject of testing.\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. **Focus on ORM and DB Integrity:** Changes to `models.py` or `database.py` directly impact data structure and persistence configuration.\n2. **Batch Leakage Bug:** The existing test (`test_batch_isolation`) explicitly checks for and detects a \"Batch leakage\" issue in the `log_transaction` service, suggesting state management is a critical area for review.\n3. **In-Memory DB:** The system uses an in-memory SQLite database (`sqlite:///:memory:`), which is important for understanding persistence behavior during testing.\n        \n        ==========================================\n        \n        CTO DIRECTIVES:\n        \"Identify the use of mutable default arguments (e.g., list, dict) in function signatures. Specifically, flag `batch_list=[]` in `log_transaction`. Verify that mutable defaults are replaced with `None` and initialized inside the function body (e.g., `batch_list = [] if batch_list is None else batch_list`).\"\n        \n        CODE DIFF TO FIX:\n        File: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,6 @@\n+\n+def log_transaction(tx_id, batch_list=[]):\n+    \n+    batch_list.append(tx_id)\n+    print(f\"Current batch: {batch_list}\")\n+    return batch_list\n\n\n        ",
