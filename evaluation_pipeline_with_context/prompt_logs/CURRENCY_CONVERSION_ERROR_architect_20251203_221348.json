  "user_prompt": "\n### REPOSITORY CONTEXT (Reference Only)\n# Repository Overview\nThis project appears to be a minimal implementation of a Core Banking System, focusing on database modeling for accounts and basic financial services like currency conversion. It uses SQLAlchemy for ORM and defines core entities like `Account`.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy (ORM)\n- Key Dependencies: `pytest`, `decimal`\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe structure is flat, focusing on core components (`models.py`, `database.py`) and a dedicated `tests/` directory for unit testing. It follows a standard Python application layout where data models and database setup are separated.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nUses SQLAlchemy's declarative base for defining ORM models. Testing relies on `pytest` and uses `Decimal` for precise financial calculations, asserting results within a small tolerance.\n\n# Key Files\n- `database.py`: Sets up the SQLAlchemy engine, session factory, and declarative base (`Base`).\n- `models.py`: Defines the core `Account` ORM model with `id` and `balance` columns.\n- `tests/test_currency.py`: Contains unit tests for the `convert_currency` service function, validating conversion logic.\n- `services.py` (Inferred): Contains business logic like `convert_currency`, tested by the test files.\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. Financial data (`balance`, currency amounts) must use `Decimal` for precision; floating-point numbers are strictly prohibited.\n2. Database interactions are managed via SQLAlchemy ORM; changes to models must be reflected in `models.py`.\n3. The current database setup uses an in-memory SQLite engine (`sqlite:///:memory:`) suitable only for testing/development.\n\n### CTO DIRECTIVES\nVerify that the exchange rate source is externalized (not hardcoded in code). Check the mathematical conversion logic for accuracy (e.g., ensure multiplication/division is correct when converting to/from the base currency). Confirm that all currency amounts use `Decimal` for precision throughout the function.\n\n### CODE DIFF TO FIX\nFile: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,21 @@\n+\n+from decimal import Decimal\n+\n+# Mock rates\n+RATES = {\n+    \"USD\": Decimal(\"1.0\"),\n+    \"EUR\": Decimal(\"0.85\"), # 1 USD = 0.85 EUR\n+    \"GBP\": Decimal(\"0.75\")  # 1 USD = 0.75 GBP\n+}\n+\n+def convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency):\n+    if from_currency not in RATES or to_currency not in RATES:\n+        return None\n+        \n+    \n+    if from_currency == \"USD\" and to_currency == \"EUR\":\n+        return amount / RATES[\"EUR\"]\n+        \n+    \n+    base_amount = amount / RATES[from_currency]\n+    return base_amount * RATES[to_currency]\n\n\n",
