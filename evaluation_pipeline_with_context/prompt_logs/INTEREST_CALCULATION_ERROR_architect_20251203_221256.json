  "user_prompt": "\n### REPOSITORY CONTEXT (Reference Only)\n# Repository Overview\nThis project appears to be a minimal implementation of a Core Banking System component, specifically focusing on account management and financial operations like applying interest. It uses an in-memory SQLite database for persistence and testing.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy (ORM), pytest (Testing)\n- Key Dependencies: sqlalchemy, pytest, decimal\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe structure is flat, separating database configuration (`database.py`), ORM models (`models.py`), and business logic (implied in `services.py`, tested in `tests/`). It follows a standard Python package layout with a dedicated `tests/` directory.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nThe codebase uses SQLAlchemy's declarative base for defining ORM models. Database setup and teardown are managed via pytest fixtures to ensure isolated testing environments. Financial values are handled using Python's `Decimal` type for precision.\n\n# Key Files\n- `models.py`: Defines the `Account` ORM model, including `id` and `balance` fields.\n- `database.py`: Configures the SQLAlchemy engine (in-memory SQLite) and session factory, and defines the `Base` for models.\n- `tests/test_interest.py`: Contains unit tests for the `apply_monthly_interest` service function, including database setup/teardown fixtures.\n- `services.py` (Implied): Contains the core business logic, such as the `apply_monthly_interest` function (not provided, but referenced).\n- `README`: Project title (\"Core Banking System\").\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. **Financial Precision:** All monetary calculations must use `Decimal` to avoid floating-point errors, as demonstrated in `models.py` and `test_interest.py`.\n2. **Database Isolation:** Tests rely on the `db_session` fixture to create and drop tables for every test, ensuring test isolation. Changes to models or database setup must respect this pattern.\n3. **ORM Usage:** Data access should be performed using SQLAlchemy ORM methods (sessions, queries) defined in `database.py`.\n\n### CTO DIRECTIVES\nCheck for the absence of database locking mechanisms (e.g., `SELECT FOR UPDATE`) or versioning fields (optimistic locking) on the `Account` object during the update transaction. Verify that `rate_percent` is handled as a `Decimal` type throughout the calculation to prevent floating-point errors when interacting with `account.balance`. Confirm that the database session is properly closed or managed after the commit/error path.\n\n### CODE DIFF TO FIX\nFile: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,16 @@\n+\n+from database import Session\n+from models import Account\n+from decimal import Decimal\n+\n+def apply_monthly_interest(account_id, rate_percent):\n+    session = Session()\n+    account = session.query(Account).get(account_id)\n+    \n+    if not account: return \"Error\"\n+    \n+    interest = account.balance * rate_percent\n+    account.balance += interest\n+    \n+    session.commit()\n+    return account.balance\n\n\n",
