  "user_prompt": "\n### REPOSITORY CONTEXT (Reference Only)\n# Repository Overview\nThis repository appears to be a minimal implementation of a core banking system component, focusing on database modeling for accounts and potentially transaction logging/processing. It uses SQLAlchemy for ORM and database interaction.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy\n- Key Dependencies: `sqlalchemy`, `pytest` (for testing)\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe structure is flat, focusing on core components (`models.py`, `database.py`) and a dedicated `tests/` directory. It follows a standard Python package layout for defining models and database setup.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nUses SQLAlchemy's declarative base for defining ORM models. Models use standard Python class definitions inheriting from `Base`. Testing uses the `pytest` framework.\n\n# Key Files\n- `models.py`: Defines the `Account` ORM model, including primary key and balance fields.\n- `database.py`: Sets up the SQLAlchemy engine (in-memory SQLite), session factory, and the declarative `Base`.\n- `tests/test_batch.py`: Contains unit tests, specifically demonstrating a potential bug related to transaction batch isolation/leakage (suggesting a stateful service).\n- `services.py` (Implied/Referenced): Contains business logic, specifically the `log_transaction` function tested in `test_batch.py`.\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. The database setup uses an in-memory SQLite engine (`sqlite:///:memory:`), which is suitable for testing but implies the production setup would require configuration changes.\n2. Reviewers must pay close attention to state management in service functions (like `log_transaction`) as `test_batch_isolation` explicitly flags a potential batch leakage/isolation bug.\n3. All persistent data structures are defined in `models.py` using SQLAlchemy ORM conventions.\n\n### CTO DIRECTIVES\nIdentify the use of mutable default arguments (e.g., list, dict) in function signatures. Specifically, flag `batch_list=[]` in `log_transaction`. Verify that mutable defaults are replaced with `None` and initialized inside the function body (e.g., `batch_list = [] if batch_list is None else batch_list`).\n\n### CODE DIFF TO FIX\nFile: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,6 @@\n+\n+def log_transaction(tx_id, batch_list=[]):\n+    \n+    batch_list.append(tx_id)\n+    print(f\"Current batch: {batch_list}\")\n+    return batch_list\n\n\n",
