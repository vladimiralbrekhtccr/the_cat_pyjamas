  "user_prompt": "\n### REPOSITORY CONTEXT (Reference Only)\n# Repository Overview\nThis project appears to be a minimal implementation of a core banking system component, focusing on database modeling for accounts and basic transaction logging. It uses SQLAlchemy for ORM and defines the fundamental `Account` entity.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy (ORM)\n- Key Dependencies: `sqlalchemy`, `pytest` (for testing)\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe structure is flat, separating database configuration (`database.py`), ORM models (`models.py`), and testing logic (`tests/`). It follows a standard Python package layout for small applications.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nUses SQLAlchemy's declarative base for defining models. Database interaction is centralized via `database.py` for engine and session management. The `tests/` directory suggests a focus on unit testing.\n\n# Key Files\n- `models.py`: Defines the core `Account` database schema (ID, balance).\n- `database.py`: Configures the SQLAlchemy engine (in-memory SQLite) and session factory.\n- `tests/test_batch.py`: Contains tests, specifically checking for transaction batch isolation issues (suggesting a potential bug in the `services` module, which is not provided).\n- `services.py` (Inferred): Contains business logic like `log_transaction`.\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. The database uses an in-memory SQLite engine (`sqlite:///:memory:`), which is suitable for testing but must be replaced for production persistence.\n2. Reviewers should pay close attention to state management in `services.py` (e.g., `log_transaction`) as `test_batch_isolation` explicitly flags potential batch leakage/state contamination issues.\n3. All numeric fields, like `balance`, use `Numeric(10, 2)` for precise decimal storage.\n\n### CTO DIRECTIVES\nFlag the use of mutable default arguments (specifically `batch_list=[]`). Verify that the function is refactored to use `batch_list = None` and initialize the list inside the function body (`if batch_list is None: batch_list = []`) to ensure each function call maintains its own independent state.\n\n### CODE DIFF TO FIX\nFile: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,6 @@\n+\n+def log_transaction(tx_id, batch_list=[]):\n+    \n+    batch_list.append(tx_id)\n+    print(f\"Current batch: {batch_list}\")\n+    return batch_list\n\n\n",
