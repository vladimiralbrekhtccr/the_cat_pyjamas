  "user_prompt": "\n### REPOSITORY CONTEXT (Reference Only)\n# Repository Overview\nThis project appears to be a minimal implementation of a Core Banking System component, specifically focusing on account modeling and database setup. Its primary purpose is to define core data structures (like `Account`) and establish a basic SQLAlchemy connection for persistence.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy\n- Key Dependencies: `sqlalchemy`, `pytest` (for testing)\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe structure is flat and minimal, centered around defining database models (`models.py`) and the database connection/session setup (`database.py`). A `tests/` directory holds unit tests.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nUses Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) via SQLAlchemy's declarative base. Models inherit from `Base`. A critical pattern/anti-pattern observed in tests is the potential for global state modification (template corruption) when creating new objects, suggesting a need for defensive copying in service functions.\n\n# Key Files\n- `models.py`: Defines the core database schema, specifically the `Account` model.\n- `database.py`: Configures the SQLAlchemy engine (in-memory SQLite) and session factory (`Session`).\n- `tests/test_template.py`: Contains unit tests, highlighting potential issues with mutable global state management in service logic.\n- `services.py` (Implied): Contains business logic functions like `create_custom_account` which are tested.\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. The database setup uses an in-memory SQLite engine (`sqlite:///:memory:`), suitable only for testing or ephemeral use.\n2. Reviewers must strictly check service functions (like those implied in `tests/test_template.py`) for unintended side effects, specifically modification of global or shared mutable objects (e.g., templates).\n3. All persistence logic relies on SQLAlchemy ORM conventions (e.g., `Column`, `declarative_base`).\n\n### CTO DIRECTIVES\nIdentify the use of mutable global state (`STANDARD_TEMPLATE`) being passed by reference. Verify that the template instantiation logic correctly performs a deep copy (e.g., using `copy.deepcopy` or equivalent serialization/deserialization) to ensure isolation between the template and the newly created instance. Check if the `AccountConfig` class should enforce immutability or use dataclasses for safer initialization.\n\n### CODE DIFF TO FIX\nFile: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,17 @@\n+\n+class AccountConfig:\n+    def __init__(self, name, settings):\n+        self.name = name\n+        self.settings = settings # Dictionary\n+\n+# Global Template\n+STANDARD_TEMPLATE = AccountConfig(\"Standard\", {\"limit\": 1000, \"currency\": \"USD\"})\n+\n+def create_custom_account(new_name, custom_limit):\n+\n+    new_acc = STANDARD_TEMPLATE \n+    \n+    new_acc.name = new_name\n+    new_acc.settings[\"limit\"] = custom_limit\n+    \n+    return new_acc\n\n\n",
