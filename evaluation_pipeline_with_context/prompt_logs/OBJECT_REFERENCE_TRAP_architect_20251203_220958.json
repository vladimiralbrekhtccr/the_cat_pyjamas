  "user_prompt": "\n### REPOSITORY CONTEXT (Reference Only)\n# Repository Overview\nThis project appears to be a minimal implementation of a Core Banking System focusing on account management. It uses SQLAlchemy for object-relational mapping and database interaction. The primary purpose is to define and manage basic financial accounts.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy\n- Key Dependencies: pytest (for testing)\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe structure is flat, focusing on core components: `database.py` handles SQLAlchemy setup, `models.py` defines database schemas, and business logic (implied in `services.py`, though not provided) is tested in the `tests/` directory.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nUses SQLAlchemy's declarative base for defining ORM models. Models use standard Python class definitions inheriting from `Base`. A critical pattern/anti-pattern highlighted in tests is the potential modification of global template objects, suggesting a need for defensive copying in service functions.\n\n# Key Files\n- `models.py`: Defines the `Account` database schema (table name, columns, types).\n- `database.py`: Sets up the SQLAlchemy engine, session factory, and declarative base.\n- `tests/test_template.py`: Contains unit tests, specifically highlighting issues related to mutable global state (template corruption).\n- `services.py` (Implied): Contains the business logic for creating and managing accounts/templates.\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. All database interactions rely on SQLAlchemy ORM defined in `models.py` and initialized in `database.py`.\n2. Reviewers must ensure that functions manipulating global configuration objects (like `STANDARD_TEMPLATE`) use deep copies to prevent unintended side effects (mutable global state is a known issue here).\n3. The database is configured to use an in-memory SQLite database (`sqlite:///:memory:`), which is suitable for testing but implies persistence is not yet implemented for production.\n\n### CTO DIRECTIVES\nVerify that the `create_custom_account` function performs a deep copy of the `STANDARD_TEMPLATE` object (or its settings) before modification. Specifically, check for the use of `copy.deepcopy()` or equivalent mechanisms to ensure the global template remains immutable and isolated from runtime modifications.\n\n### CODE DIFF TO FIX\nFile: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,17 @@\n+\n+class AccountConfig:\n+    def __init__(self, name, settings):\n+        self.name = name\n+        self.settings = settings # Dictionary\n+\n+# Global Template\n+STANDARD_TEMPLATE = AccountConfig(\"Standard\", {\"limit\": 1000, \"currency\": \"USD\"})\n+\n+def create_custom_account(new_name, custom_limit):\n+\n+    new_acc = STANDARD_TEMPLATE \n+    \n+    new_acc.name = new_name\n+    new_acc.settings[\"limit\"] = custom_limit\n+    \n+    return new_acc\n\n\n",
