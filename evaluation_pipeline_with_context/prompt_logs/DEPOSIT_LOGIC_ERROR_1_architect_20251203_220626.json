  "user_prompt": "\n### REPOSITORY CONTEXT (Reference Only)\n# Repository Overview\nThis project appears to be a minimal implementation of a Core Banking System focusing on fundamental account management and transaction logic (e.g., deposits). It uses an in-memory SQLite database for persistence and demonstrates basic service and model definitions.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy (ORM)\n- Key Dependencies: pytest, decimal\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe structure is flat, separating database configuration (`database.py`), data models (`models.py`), and business logic (implied in `services.py`, tested in `tests/test_services.py`). Tests are isolated in the `tests/` directory.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nThe system uses SQLAlchemy's declarative base for defining ORM models. Database interactions (setup, session management) are centralized. Business logic is expected to reside in service functions (e.g., `deposit_funds`) which interact with the ORM models.\n\n# Key Files\n- `database.py`: Configures the SQLAlchemy engine (in-memory SQLite) and defines the `Base` and `Session` factory.\n- `models.py`: Defines the `Account` ORM model, including `id` and `balance` columns.\n- `tests/test_services.py`: Contains integration tests for core banking logic (like `deposit_funds`), using pytest fixtures to manage database setup and teardown.\n- `services.py` (Implied): Contains the core transaction logic (e.g., `deposit_funds`).\n- `utils.py` (Implied): Contains utility functions like `validate_currency`.\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. All persistence uses an in-memory SQLite database; changes must ensure proper session management and transaction atomicity.\n2. Financial amounts are handled using Python's `Decimal` type (as seen in tests) to ensure precision, which must be maintained across all service functions.\n3. Database setup and teardown for testing are handled via pytest fixtures that use `Base.metadata.create_all/drop_all`.\n\n### CTO DIRECTIVES\nVerify that the deposit logic uses an additive operation (`account.balance += amount`) instead of an assignment operation (`account.balance = amount`). Check for the use of database-level locking (e.g., `SELECT FOR UPDATE`) or optimistic locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent updates and race conditions during the read-modify-write cycle. Also, confirm that currency amounts are handled using a precise type (like `Decimal`) rather than standard floats or integers, which is not visible in this snippet.\n\n### CODE DIFF TO FIX\nFile: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,13 @@\n+\n+from database import Session\n+from models import Account\n+\n+def deposit_funds(account_id, amount):\n+    session = Session()\n+    account = session.query(Account).get(account_id)\n+    if not account: return \"Error\"\n+    \n+    account.balance = amount \n+    \n+    session.commit()\n+    return account.balance\n\nFile: utils.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,5 @@\n+\n+def validate_currency(amount):\n+    if amount < 0:\n+        return False\n+    return True\n\n\n",
