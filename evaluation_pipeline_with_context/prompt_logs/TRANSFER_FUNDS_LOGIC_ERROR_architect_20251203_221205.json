  "user_prompt": "\n### REPOSITORY CONTEXT (Reference Only)\n# Repository Overview\nThis project is a minimal implementation of a Core Banking System focusing on basic account management and fund transfer logic. It uses an in-memory SQLite database to define and manage `Account` entities.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy (ORM)\n- Key Dependencies: `sqlalchemy`, `pytest`, `decimal`\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe structure is flat, separating database configuration (`database.py`), ORM models (`models.py`), and business logic (implied in `services.py`, tested in `tests/`). It follows a standard ORM-based data access pattern.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nUses SQLAlchemy's declarative base for defining models. Database sessions are managed explicitly, particularly within test fixtures, ensuring setup and teardown (`create_all`, `drop_all`). Financial values are handled using Python's `Decimal` type for precision.\n\n# Key Files\n- `models.py`: Defines the `Account` SQLAlchemy model, including `id` and `balance`.\n- `database.py`: Configures the SQLAlchemy engine (in-memory SQLite) and the session factory (`Session`) and declarative base (`Base`).\n- `tests/test_transfer.py`: Contains pytest fixtures for database setup/teardown and tests the core business logic (`transfer_funds`).\n- `services.py` (Implied): Contains the `transfer_funds` business logic (not provided, but referenced by tests).\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. All financial calculations must use `Decimal` to prevent floating-point errors, as demonstrated in `models.py` and tests.\n2. Database interaction relies on SQLAlchemy ORM; changes must respect session management and transaction boundaries (though transactions are implicit in the provided code).\n3. The current database setup is in-memory (`sqlite:///:memory:`) and is primarily for testing/demonstration purposes.\n\n### CTO DIRECTIVES\nCheck for the use of database transaction isolation levels and explicit row-level locking (e.g., `SELECT FOR UPDATE`) to prevent race conditions (lost updates) during concurrent balance modification. Verify the arithmetic logic to ensure the transfer amount is correctly debited from the sender and credited to the receiver. Confirm that input validation (e.g., negative amounts) is handled.\n\n### CODE DIFF TO FIX\nFile: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,17 @@\n+\n+from database import Session\n+from models import Account\n+\n+def transfer_funds(from_id, to_id, amount):\n+    session = Session()\n+    sender = session.query(Account).get(from_id)\n+    receiver = session.query(Account).get(to_id)\n+    \n+    if not sender or not receiver: return \"Error\"\n+    if sender.balance < amount: return \"Insufficient Funds\"\n+    \n+    sender.balance -= amount\n+    receiver.balance -= amount \n+    \n+    session.commit()\n+    return True\n\n\n",
