  "user_prompt": "\n### REPOSITORY CONTEXT (Reference Only)\n# Repository Overview\nThis project appears to be a minimal implementation of a Core Banking System focusing on account management and transaction logic (like withdrawals and fee calculation). It uses an in-memory SQLite database for persistence and demonstrates basic domain modeling.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy (ORM)\n- Key Dependencies: `sqlalchemy`, `pytest`, `decimal`\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe codebase follows a simple structure with domain models (`models.py`), database configuration (`database.py`), and business logic likely residing in `services.py` and `fees.py` (inferred from tests). Tests are isolated in the `tests/` directory.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nThe project uses Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) via SQLAlchemy's declarative base for defining data models. Business logic is separated into service functions (e.g., `withdraw_funds`). Tests utilize Pytest fixtures for setting up and tearing down the database state.\n\n# Key Files\n- `models.py`: Defines the core `Account` database model using SQLAlchemy.\n- `database.py`: Configures the SQLAlchemy engine, session factory, and declarative base.\n- `services.py` (inferred): Contains core transaction logic, such as `withdraw_funds`.\n- `fees.py` (inferred): Contains logic for calculating transaction fees, such as `calculate_withdrawal_fee`.\n- `tests/test_services.py`: Contains integration tests for service functions, including database setup/teardown fixtures.\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. All persistence uses an in-memory SQLite database (`sqlite:///:memory:`), which is suitable for testing but implies this is not a production setup.\n2. Financial calculations must use Python's `Decimal` type (as seen in tests) to avoid floating-point errors.\n3. Database interactions (CRUD operations) should be handled within service functions using the SQLAlchemy session provided by the `Session` factory.\n\n### CTO DIRECTIVES\nVerify the database interaction within `withdraw_funds`. Specifically, check if the ORM session uses any form of transaction isolation or explicit locking (e.g., `SELECT FOR UPDATE`) to prevent concurrent updates during the balance check and deduction phase. Confirm that the balance validation (checking if `account.balance >= total_deduction`) is missing entirely.\n\n### CODE DIFF TO FIX\nFile: fees.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,6 @@\n+\n+from decimal import Decimal\n+\n+def calculate_withdrawal_fee(account_type, amount):\n+    fee_rate = Decimal(\"0.01\")\n+    return amount * fee_rate\n\nFile: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,17 @@\n+\n+from database import Session\n+from models import Account\n+from fees import calculate_withdrawal_fee\n+\n+def withdraw_funds(account_id, amount):\n+    session = Session()\n+    account = session.query(Account).get(account_id)\n+    if not account: return \"Error: Account not found\"\n+    \n+    fee = calculate_withdrawal_fee(account.account_type, amount)\n+    total_deduction = amount + fee\n+    \n+    account.balance = account.balance - total_deduction\n+    \n+    session.commit()\n+    return {\"new_balance\": account.balance, \"fee_charged\": fee}\n\n\n",
