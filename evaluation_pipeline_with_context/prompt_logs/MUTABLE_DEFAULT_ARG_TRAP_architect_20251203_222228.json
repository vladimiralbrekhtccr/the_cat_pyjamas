  "user_prompt": "\n### REPOSITORY CONTEXT (Reference Only)\n# Repository Overview\nThis project appears to be a minimal implementation of core banking system components, focusing on database modeling (accounts) and transaction logging services. It uses SQLAlchemy for ORM and database interaction.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy\n- Key Dependencies: `sqlalchemy`, `pytest` (for testing)\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe structure is flat, focusing on core components: `database.py` handles connection setup, `models.py` defines ORM entities, and services (like `log_transaction` implied in tests) handle business logic. Tests are isolated in the `tests/` directory.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nUses SQLAlchemy's declarative base for ORM modeling. Database connections are configured in a centralized `database.py`. Models use standard Python class definitions inheriting from `Base`.\n\n# Key Files\n- `database.py`: Initializes the SQLAlchemy engine, session factory, and declarative base (`Base`).\n- `models.py`: Defines the `Account` ORM model, including primary key and numeric balance field.\n- `tests/test_batch.py`: Contains unit tests, specifically checking for transaction isolation or \"batch leakage\" in a service function (`log_transaction`).\n- `services.py` (Implied): Contains the business logic function `log_transaction` being tested.\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. **Focus on Isolation:** A primary concern is preventing state leakage, as highlighted by `test_batch_isolation`. Reviewers must ensure services maintain clean, isolated state between calls.\n2. **Database Layer:** All persistence logic relies on SQLAlchemy ORM defined in `models.py` and configured in `database.py`. Changes to data structure must be reflected in `models.py`.\n3. **Numeric Precision:** The `balance` field uses `Numeric(10, 2)`, indicating a requirement for fixed-point decimal precision for monetary values.\n\n### CTO DIRECTIVES\nFlag the use of mutable default arguments (specifically `batch_list=[]`). Verify that if a list or dictionary is required as a default, the standard Python idiom (e.g., `batch_list = [] if batch_list is None else batch_list`) is used to prevent state leakage. Assess the impact of this shared state on concurrent requests.\n\n### CODE DIFF TO FIX\nFile: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,6 @@\n+\n+def log_transaction(tx_id, batch_list=[]):\n+    \n+    batch_list.append(tx_id)\n+    print(f\"Current batch: {batch_list}\")\n+    return batch_list\n\n\n",
