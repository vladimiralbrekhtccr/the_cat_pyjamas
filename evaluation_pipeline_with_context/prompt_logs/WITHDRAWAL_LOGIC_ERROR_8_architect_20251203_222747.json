  "user_prompt": "\n### REPOSITORY CONTEXT (Reference Only)\n# Repository Overview\nThis project is a minimal implementation of a Core Banking System, focusing on fundamental account management operations like withdrawals and fee calculation. It uses an in-memory database for persistence and includes unit tests for core business logic.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy (ORM), pytest (Testing)\n- Key Dependencies: `sqlalchemy`, `pytest`, `decimal`\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe codebase follows a standard service-oriented structure with clear separation between data models (`models.py`), database configuration (`database.py`), and business logic (implied in `services.py` and `fees.py`). Tests are isolated in the `tests/` directory.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nThe project uses SQLAlchemy's ORM for database interaction, defining models as classes inheriting from `Base`. Business logic is tested using fixtures to manage the database state (setup/teardown) per test. Financial values are consistently handled using Python's `Decimal` type to ensure precision.\n\n# Key Files\n- `models.py`: Defines the `Account` SQLAlchemy model and its schema.\n- `database.py`: Configures the SQLAlchemy engine, session factory, and declarative base (using an in-memory SQLite database).\n- `services.py` (implied): Contains core banking operations like `withdraw_funds`.\n- `fees.py` (implied): Contains business logic for calculating transaction fees, e.g., `calculate_withdrawal_fee`.\n- `tests/test_services.py`: Contains integration tests for service layer logic, including database interaction and transaction handling.\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. All financial calculations must use the `Decimal` type to prevent floating-point errors.\n2. Database interactions (CRUD operations) should be handled within sessions managed by SQLAlchemy.\n3. New features must include corresponding unit tests in the `tests/` directory, especially for fee calculation and service logic.\n\n### CTO DIRECTIVES\nVerify the database interaction in `withdraw_funds`. Specifically, check if the session uses any form of locking (e.g., `SELECT FOR UPDATE` or optimistic locking via version columns) when fetching the `Account` object before modifying the balance. The current implementation is vulnerable to lost updates and negative balances under concurrency.\n\n### CODE DIFF TO FIX\nFile: fees.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,6 @@\n+\n+from decimal import Decimal\n+\n+def calculate_withdrawal_fee(account_type, amount):\n+    fee_rate = Decimal(\"0.01\")\n+    return amount * fee_rate\n\nFile: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,17 @@\n+\n+from database import Session\n+from models import Account\n+from fees import calculate_withdrawal_fee\n+\n+def withdraw_funds(account_id, amount):\n+    session = Session()\n+    account = session.query(Account).get(account_id)\n+    if not account: return \"Error: Account not found\"\n+    \n+    fee = calculate_withdrawal_fee(account.account_type, amount)\n+    total_deduction = amount + fee\n+    \n+    account.balance = account.balance - total_deduction\n+    \n+    session.commit()\n+    return {\"new_balance\": account.balance, \"fee_charged\": fee}\n\n\n",
