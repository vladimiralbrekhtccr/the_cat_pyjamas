  "user_prompt": "\n### REPOSITORY CONTEXT (Reference Only)\n# Repository Overview\nThis project implements the core data model and database setup for a Global Forex Banking System, focusing on ensuring high-precision math for all currency operations. Its primary purpose is to define financial entities (Users, Wallets) and enforce the use of precise numeric types for balances to prevent floating-point errors.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy, pytest\n- Key Dependencies: `sqlalchemy`, `decimal` (implicitly required for precision), `pytest`\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe codebase follows a standard Python application structure with separate files for database configuration (`database.py`) and ORM models (`models.py`). Testing is isolated in the `tests/` directory, which contains fixtures and specific tests designed to validate numeric precision.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nThe core convention is the strict use of `sqlalchemy.Numeric` with high precision (e.g., `Numeric(14, 4)`) for all financial balances, coupled with Python's `decimal.Decimal` type in application logic and tests. The system uses an in-memory SQLite database for development/testing.\n\n# Key Files\n- `models.py`: Defines the SQLAlchemy ORM models (`User`, `Wallet`) and enforces `Numeric(14, 4)` for `balance`.\n- `database.py`: Configures the SQLAlchemy engine (in-memory SQLite) and session factory.\n- `tests/test_math_drift.py`: Contains tests specifically designed to catch floating-point artifacts and ensure `Decimal` integrity.\n- `tests/test_types.py`: Validates that balances remain `Decimal` types throughout transactions.\n- `exchange_service.py` (Inferred): The module containing the core business logic for currency exchange, heavily tested for precision.\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. **Precision is Paramount:** Any change involving calculations or database storage of currency amounts *must* use `decimal.Decimal` and the defined `Numeric` column types; standard Python floats are strictly forbidden.\n2. **Testing Focus:** Reviewers should pay close attention to tests in the `tests/` directory, as they define the required precision and type integrity standards for financial operations.\n3. **Database Setup:** The system uses `sqlalchemy.declarative_base` and an in-memory SQLite engine, which is critical for understanding the testing environment.\n\n### CTO DIRECTIVES\nVerify that all external inputs (rates, fees) are immediately converted to `Decimal` upon retrieval, or stored as strings/integers and converted to `Decimal` before any arithmetic operation. Specifically, check `currency_utils.py` to ensure `get_live_rate` and `get_platform_fee` return `Decimal` objects, and confirm that the final update to `tgt_wallet.balance` uses a `Decimal` type.\n\n### CODE DIFF TO FIX\nFile: currency_utils.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,15 @@\n+\n+# Helper to simulate fetching live rates\n+# TRAP: These are raw Python floats. \n+# If multiplied by Decimal, result becomes float.\n+def get_live_rate(from_curr, to_curr):\n+    rates = {\n+        ('USD', 'EUR'): 0.92,  # 1 USD = 0.92 EUR\n+        ('EUR', 'USD'): 1.08,\n+        ('USD', 'JPY'): 150.55,\n+    }\n+    return rates.get((from_curr, to_curr), 1.0)\n+\n+# TRAP: Fee is a float\n+def get_platform_fee():\n+    return 0.015 # 1.5% fee\n\nFile: exchange_service.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,47 @@\n+\n+from database import Session\n+from models import Wallet\n+from currency_utils import get_live_rate, get_platform_fee\n+from decimal import Decimal\n+\n+def execute_exchange(user_id, from_curr, to_curr, amount_str):\n+    session = Session()\n+    \n+    # 1.
