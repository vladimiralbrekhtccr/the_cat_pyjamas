  "user_prompt": "\n### REPOSITORY CONTEXT (Reference Only)\n# Repository Overview\nThis project implements the core data models and database setup for a Global Forex Banking System, focusing heavily on ensuring high-precision arithmetic for all currency operations. Its primary purpose is to manage user wallets and balances using strict decimal types to prevent floating-point errors common in financial applications.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy\n- Key Dependencies: `sqlalchemy`, `pytest`, `decimal` (Python standard library)\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe structure is minimal, following a standard Python application pattern with separate files for database configuration (`database.py`) and ORM models (`models.py`). Testing fixtures and logic are isolated within the `tests/` directory.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nThe core convention is the mandatory use of `Numeric(14, 4)` in SQLAlchemy models and the Python `Decimal` type for all financial calculations and storage. This pattern is enforced via dedicated tests (`test_math_drift.py`, `test_types.py`) designed to fail if standard Python floats are introduced.\n\n# Key Files\n- `models.py`: Defines the SQLAlchemy ORM models (`User`, `Wallet`), critically using `Numeric(14, 4)` for the `balance` field.\n- `database.py`: Configures the SQLAlchemy engine (in-memory SQLite) and session factory.\n- `tests/test_math_drift.py`: Contains tests specifically designed to catch floating-point artifacts and ensure `Decimal` usage integrity.\n- `tests/test_types.py`: Verifies that balances remain strict `Decimal` types throughout transactions.\n- `exchange_service.py` (Inferred): Contains the core business logic for currency exchange, which is tested by the fixtures.\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. **No Floats Allowed:** Any introduction of standard Python `float` types for currency amounts or rates is a critical bug and must be rejected. Use `Decimal` exclusively.\n2. **Precision Check:** Ensure all database columns storing monetary values use `Numeric(14, 4)` or higher precision if required, matching the `Decimal` precision used in application logic.\n3. **Testing Focus:** Reviewers should pay close attention to the test files, as they define the strict financial integrity requirements of the system. New features must include tests verifying decimal integrity.\n\n### CTO DIRECTIVES\nVerify that all monetary values, rates, and fees are strictly represented and calculated using `decimal.Decimal`. Specifically, check `currency_utils.py` to ensure `get_live_rate` and `get_platform_fee` return `Decimal` objects, and confirm that the final update to `tgt_wallet.balance` uses a calculated value that has maintained `Decimal` precision throughout the process.\n\n### CODE DIFF TO FIX\nFile: currency_utils.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,15 @@\n+\n+# Helper to simulate fetching live rates\n+# TRAP: These are raw Python floats. \n+# If multiplied by Decimal, result becomes float.\n+def get_live_rate(from_curr, to_curr):\n+    rates = {\n+        ('USD', 'EUR'): 0.92,  # 1 USD = 0.92 EUR\n+        ('EUR', 'USD'): 1.08,\n+        ('USD', 'JPY'): 150.55,\n+    }\n+    return rates.get((from_curr, to_curr), 1.0)\n+\n+# TRAP: Fee is a float\n+def get_platform_fee():\n+    return 0.015 # 1.5% fee\n\nFile: exchange_service.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,47 @@\n+\n+from database import Session\n+from models import Wallet\n+from currency_utils import get_live_rate, get_platform_fee\n+from decimal import Decimal\n+\n+def execute_exchange(user_id, from_curr, to_curr, amount_str):\n+    session = Session()\n+    \n+    # 1.
