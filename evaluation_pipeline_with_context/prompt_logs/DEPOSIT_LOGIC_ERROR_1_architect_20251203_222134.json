  "user_prompt": "\n### REPOSITORY CONTEXT (Reference Only)\n# Repository Overview\nThis project is a minimal implementation of a Core Banking System, focusing on fundamental account management and transaction logic (e.g., deposits). It uses an in-memory SQLite database for persistence and demonstrates basic service and model definitions.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy (ORM)\n- Key Dependencies: pytest, decimal\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe structure follows a standard Python application pattern, separating database configuration (`database.py`), data models (`models.py`), and business logic (implied in `services.py`, tested in `tests/test_services.py`). Tests are isolated in the `tests/` directory.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nThe codebase uses SQLAlchemy's ORM for database interaction. Testing relies heavily on pytest fixtures (`db_session`) to set up and tear down a clean, isolated database state for each test, ensuring transactional integrity during testing.\n\n# Key Files\n- `database.py`: Configures the SQLAlchemy engine (in-memory SQLite) and defines the `Base` for models and `Session` factory.\n- `models.py`: Defines the `Account` model, the primary entity, using SQLAlchemy columns.\n- `services.py` (Implied): Contains core business logic like `deposit_funds`.\n- `tests/test_services.py`: Contains integration tests for service logic, using fixtures to manage database state.\n- `tests/test_utils.py`: Contains unit tests for utility functions like currency validation.\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. All database operations must be performed within a SQLAlchemy session and should handle `Decimal` types correctly for financial accuracy.\n2. The current setup uses an in-memory SQLite database, which is suitable for testing but implies persistence logic is not yet fully implemented for production.\n3. Reviewers must ensure that changes to service logic (e.g., `deposit_funds`) are accompanied by corresponding updates to the database setup/teardown in `tests/test_services.py` if new models or data are required.\n\n### CTO DIRECTIVES\nVerify that the deposit logic uses addition (`account.balance += amount`) instead of assignment (`account.balance = amount`). Check for the implementation of pessimistic or optimistic locking mechanisms (e.g., `SELECT FOR UPDATE` or versioning) to prevent concurrent updates and race conditions. Ensure that currency amounts are handled using a precise data type (like `Decimal`) rather than standard floats or integers.\n\n### CODE DIFF TO FIX\nFile: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,13 @@\n+\n+from database import Session\n+from models import Account\n+\n+def deposit_funds(account_id, amount):\n+    session = Session()\n+    account = session.query(Account).get(account_id)\n+    if not account: return \"Error\"\n+    \n+    account.balance = amount \n+    \n+    session.commit()\n+    return account.balance\n\nFile: utils.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,5 @@\n+\n+def validate_currency(amount):\n+    if amount < 0:\n+        return False\n+    return True\n\n\n",
