  "user_prompt": "\n        REPOSITORY CONTEXT:\n        # Repository Overview\nThis project is a minimal implementation of a Core Banking System focusing on basic account management and fund transfer logic. It uses an in-memory SQLite database to define and manage `Account` entities and their balances.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy (ORM), pytest (Testing)\n- Key Dependencies: sqlalchemy, pytest, decimal\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe structure is flat, separating database configuration (`database.py`), data models (`models.py`), and business logic (implied in `services.py`, tested in `tests/`). It follows a standard ORM pattern for data persistence.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nUses SQLAlchemy's declarative base for defining models. Database interactions (engine creation, session management) are centralized in `database.py`. Testing uses pytest fixtures to manage database setup and teardown for isolated tests.\n\n# Key Files\n- `database.py`: Configures the SQLAlchemy engine, session factory, and declarative base.\n- `models.py`: Defines the `Account` ORM model with `id` and `balance` fields.\n- `tests/test_transfer.py`: Contains unit tests for the core fund transfer business logic, including database fixture setup.\n- `services.py` (Implied): Contains the `transfer_funds` business logic function (not provided, but referenced by tests).\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. All persistence logic relies on SQLAlchemy ORM; direct SQL should be avoided.\n2. Financial amounts are handled using Python's `Decimal` type (implied by test usage) to ensure precision.\n3. Database setup and teardown are managed via pytest fixtures, ensuring tests run against a clean state.\n        \n        ==========================================\n        \n        CTO DIRECTIVES:\n        \"1. Verify the transaction logic for atomicity and isolation. Specifically, check if the database session uses pessimistic locking (e.g., `SELECT FOR UPDATE`) or optimistic locking to prevent race conditions during the balance check and update. 2. Scrutinize the balance update arithmetic: `receiver.balance -= amount` is incorrect; it should be `receiver.balance += amount`. 3. Confirm that currency amounts are handled using a fixed-point decimal type (e.g., Python's `Decimal`) rather than floating-point numbers to prevent precision errors.\"\n        \n        CODE DIFF TO FIX:\n        File: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,17 @@\n+\n+from database import Session\n+from models import Account\n+\n+def transfer_funds(from_id, to_id, amount):\n+    session = Session()\n+    sender = session.query(Account).get(from_id)\n+    receiver = session.query(Account).get(to_id)\n+    \n+    if not sender or not receiver: return \"Error\"\n+    if sender.balance < amount: return \"Insufficient Funds\"\n+    \n+    sender.balance -= amount\n+    receiver.balance -= amount \n+    \n+    session.commit()\n+    return True\n\n\n        ",
