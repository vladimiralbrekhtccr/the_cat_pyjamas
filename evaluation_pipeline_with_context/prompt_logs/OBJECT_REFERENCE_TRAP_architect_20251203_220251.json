  "user_prompt": "\n        REPOSITORY CONTEXT:\n        # Repository Overview\nThis project appears to be a minimal implementation of a Core Banking System component, focusing on database modeling and basic service logic (implied by tests). It uses SQLAlchemy for object-relational mapping to manage `Account` entities.\n\n# Tech Stack\n- Languages: Python\n- Frameworks: SQLAlchemy\n- Key Dependencies: `pytest` (for testing)\n\n# Architecture & Structure\nThe structure is minimal, separating database configuration (`database.py`), data models (`models.py`), and testing (`tests/`). It follows a standard Python package layout for small applications.\n\n# Code Conventions & Patterns\nUses SQLAlchemy's declarative base for defining models. The test file highlights a critical pattern/anti-pattern: the potential for global state mutation (`STANDARD_TEMPLATE`) within service functions, which must be carefully managed (e.g., by deep copying templates).\n\n# Key Files\n- `models.py`: Defines the core database schema, specifically the `Account` table.\n- `database.py`: Configures the SQLAlchemy engine, session factory, and declarative base.\n- `tests/test_template.py`: Contains unit tests, specifically demonstrating and testing service logic related to account creation templates.\n- `services.py` (Implied): Contains the business logic functions like `create_custom_account`.\n\n# Important Context for Reviewers\n1. All database interactions rely on SQLAlchemy ORM defined in `database.py` and `models.py`.\n2. Reviewers must strictly check service functions (like those implied in `tests/`) for unintended side effects, especially mutation of global or shared objects (e.g., the `STANDARD_TEMPLATE` issue highlighted in the test).\n3. The current database is configured as an in-memory SQLite instance, suitable for testing but not production.\n        \n        ==========================================\n        \n        CTO DIRECTIVES:\n        \"Verify that the `create_custom_account` function performs a deep copy of the `STANDARD_TEMPLATE` object before modification. Specifically, check for the use of `copy.deepcopy()` or an equivalent factory method to ensure the global template remains immutable and thread-safe. Assess the impact of using a global mutable object (`STANDARD_TEMPLATE`) in a multi-threaded or concurrent environment.\"\n        \n        CODE DIFF TO FIX:\n        File: services.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,17 @@\n+\n+class AccountConfig:\n+    def __init__(self, name, settings):\n+        self.name = name\n+        self.settings = settings # Dictionary\n+\n+# Global Template\n+STANDARD_TEMPLATE = AccountConfig(\"Standard\", {\"limit\": 1000, \"currency\": \"USD\"})\n+\n+def create_custom_account(new_name, custom_limit):\n+\n+    new_acc = STANDARD_TEMPLATE \n+    \n+    new_acc.name = new_name\n+    new_acc.settings[\"limit\"] = custom_limit\n+    \n+    return new_acc\n\n\n        ",
